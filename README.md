# MorgVerd

I am fairly active on Github. However all of the fun projects that I work on have to be private, either because I'm working on a project for someone who wants private source, or the project is still in active use by me such as my Website. 

For now, Just feel free to goto [My main website](https://morgverd.com), or alternatively, [My development website](https://morgverd.dev).
You can also contact me at [Discord](https://r.morgverd.com/discord) if you need me.
Alternatively you can [Email Me](mailto:me@morgverd.com?subject=[GitHub]). (I may be slow responding over email).

Thanks, morgverd.
